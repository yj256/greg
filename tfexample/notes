Design decisions:
1. Which optimizer to use, at what learning rate?
2. What type of metrics are needed to understand the model?



Two approaches:

1. Pre-defined Estimators:
	DNNRegressor
	simple to use
	less control
	limited metrics for testing/ understanding model
	can use tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics to add metrics

2. tf.estimator.Estimator (cutomized estimator):
	Can design your own model
	still relatively high level abstraction
	more control but also requires more understand and coding
	can
